## Welcome! <br>
This is a small side project done using React-Redux to help me generate content for my D&D campaings!<br>
The primary goal was helping out with all of the calculations and manual work that goes into creating or adjusting creatures, bosses, and items.

## What's New
Current work is focusing entirely on the creature builder. It still has a long way to go before it helps anyone, but I believe, it can change the world!

<br>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
