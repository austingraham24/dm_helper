## DM Helper <br>
This is a small side project done using React-Redux to help me generate content for my D&D campaigns!<br>
The primary goal was helping out with all of the calculations and manual work that goes into creating or adjusting creatures, bosses, and items.<br><br>
Current work is focusing entirely on the creature builder. It still has a long way to go before it helps anyone, but I believe, it can change the world!

## What's New
The creature builder is almost online. Damage forms have been added and given a dice expression can calculate avg damage. Also, given flat damage and a dice type, the form can auto calculate a dice expression.

## Setup and Getting Started
Before getting started you will need to install Node.js(https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install`. Once that is done run `npm start`.
This will open a web browser window at localhost:3000
